## **SpaceX**: Traveling to the otherside of the world in **under a hour**
During our final Deep Dive session of the year, we have been tasked with the development of an advanced IT System for international travel, specifically for SpaceX, a renowned organization in the realm of space travel. As a cohesive team, we are obligated to focus on at least one of the four available options that encompass the features of SpaceX's forthcoming Spaceports. Upon careful consideration, I have compiled a list of both the advantages and disadvantages associated with this endeavor:

## **Advantages:**
1. The presence of an efficient and user-friendly scheduling system, ensuring streamlined operations.
2. An enhanced travel experience, achieved through optimized passenger capacity, thus maximizing comfort and convenience.
3. Facilitated and timely maintenance and repair operations, thanks to designated repair flights, which contribute to the overall reliability of the system.
4. The availability of configurable maintenance windows, guaranteeing both safety and optimal performance.
5. The utilization of an intuitive calendar interface, enhancing user experience and simplifying usage.

## **Disadvantages:**
1. The inherent complexity and technical challenges involved in implementing such a sophisticated IT System.
2. Potential operational constraints that may arise in relation to maintenance and repair flights, which could impact overall operations.
3. The potential administrative burden resulting from regulatory compliance, necessitating careful attention and adherence to regulatory guidelines.
