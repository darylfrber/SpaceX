# **SpaceX** International Travel, **Starports** & **IT System**
## **Description:** 

During our last Deep Dive of the year, we are requested to work on an IT System for international travel from famous space travel organization, SpaceX. We must work as a team on at least one out of four options that make up for the features of SpaceX's new and upcoming Spaceports. These are the few advantages and disadvantages I have brainstormed:

## **Advantages:**
- Efficient and user-friendly scheduling system
- Enhanced travel experience with optimized passenger capacity
- Timely maintenance and repairs facilitated by designated repair flights
- Configurable maintenance windows to ensure safety and performance
- Intuitive calendar interface for easy use

## **Disadvantages:**
- Implementation complexity and technical challenges
- Possible operational constraints related to maintenance and repair flights
- Administrative burden for regulatory compliance
